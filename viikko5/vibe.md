# Vibe Coding with Copilot

The AI ended up with a working application. The code itself was hard to parce however, because it was mostly in Javascrpt eventhought I prompted it only to use minimal Javascript.

Some visual effects were poorly formated that would have been easily spotted by a human coder. I was also suprised how ugly colors the AI chose when I prompted it to use pastel colors.

I hadn't vibe-coded quite this hard before, so it was an interesting experince.
