## Retrospective

Several different types of meetings are included in the Scrum approach to software development. One of them is the **retrospective**.

Retrospectives are meetings held between sprints, where team members reflect on the workflow of the previous sprint. The shape and form of the meeting can vary, but the goal of the gathering is to have a *meta* discussion about the work at hand.  

Instead of focusing on the specifics of the work done, the retrospective emphasizes **how** the work was done:
- What factors progressed the work
- What factors hindered it
- What could be improved in the next sprint

One approach to retrospectives is the **Glad, Sad, Mad** approach. Each participant categorizes observations they made during the sprint into the three aforementioned columns. The observations are grouped into similar groups of issues, and then the group votes on which issue they would like to discuss.
