#  Pull request code review by Copilot

The only suggestion made by Copilot was to move the constant to above the init-function of the TennisGame-class. This was mostly a formatting suggestion. I did implement the change, but it didn't seem like a very in-depth suggestion, but rather like some a linter could have picked up on. 

Perhaps the reason there were so few suggestions was that I had already used generative text suggestions while coding for better formatting. 

I put quite some time into writing the description of the pull request, and didn't get any feedback on it from the AI.
